## Goal
Build a simple home-style network in Cisco Packet Tracer using DHCP.

## Status
Completed (basic setup).

## Topology
- PC connected via Ethernet to a wireless router
- Laptop connected via Wi-Fi to the wireless router
- Wireless router connected to a modem
- Modem connected to an upstream network (Internet simulation)

## IP Configuration
- PC: IP address obtained automatically via DHCP
- Laptop: IP address obtained automatically via DHCP
- Subnet: 192.168.0.0 / 24
- Default Gateway: Provided automatically by the router

## What I did
- Placed and connected all network devices
- Configured the wireless router as the central network device
- Enabled DHCP on all devices
- Set PC and laptop to obtain IP configuration automatically
- Verified that both devices received valid IP addresses

## What I learned
- DHCP automatically assigns IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway
- End devices do not require manual IP configuration when DHCP is enabled
- Wired and wireless devices can operate in the same subnet
- A home network typically uses a router with integrated DHCP
